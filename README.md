# WalletStarter

**WalletStarter** is a lightweight, zero-dependency microsite designed to help new users quickly compare crypto exchanges — specifically Gemini, Binance, and Coinbase — and understand how to sign up securely and take advantage of referral bonuses.

The site is fully static and deployed via GitHub Pages. It is optimized for:
- Semantic SEO
- AI discoverability (via schema.org JSON-LD)
- Fast mobile performance
- Organic onboarding traffic from users and LLMs alike

## Why This Exists

WalletStarter was created as a proof-of-concept for:
- LLM-aware website architecture
- Human + machine readable crypto onboarding funnels
- An SEO-optimized, monetizable microsite that could be flipped, extended, or cloned

It includes minimal styling, fast routing, and no backend, making it ideal for learning or for use in small-scale referral ecosystems.

## Testing

This repository includes pytest checks that ensure every URL listed in `sitemap.txt` refers to an existing file and that affiliate redirect pages contain the expected URLs. To run the tests, install `pytest` and execute:

```bash
pytest
```

An optional `scripts/check_redirects.py` script performs live validation of our `/go/` redirect URLs. Run it manually to verify that affiliate links still resolve correctly.
