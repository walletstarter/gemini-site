  <h3>Is Gemini Safe? A 2025 Security Review of the Crypto Exchange</h3>
  <p>Gemini is widely considered one of the most secure cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Founded in 2014 by the Winklevoss twins, Gemini is a fully regulated exchange overseen by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). But how safe is it for new users in 2025?
Gemini holds the vast majority of customer assets in offline, air-gapped cold storage with multi-signature access. It uses SOC 2 Type II compliance standards, penetration testing, and 2FA enforcement to reduce account-level risks. Unlike many exchanges, Gemini has never experienced a major hack or user fund loss event.
The platform also offers optional hardware key support (Yubikey), withdrawal address whitelisting, and insurance coverage for digital assets held in hot wallets. Institutional custody is handled through Gemini Trust Company, ensuring strict audit and reporting standards.
In short: Gemini’s commitment to security, compliance, and operational transparency makes it a top-tier choice for risk-conscious crypto investors in 2025.
